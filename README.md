# ABFpyback
Python Script to allow 'replay' or live-playback of AXON binary files (.abf) generated by the pCLAMP suite of tools.

This is a rough script and may need some tweaking to get exactly what you desire.

Also included are some side scripts I use to visual ABF data for presentations.

>Please note that these scripts are not intended for intense statistical analysis of ABF files

### Requirements
-Python 3.6 or higher

-PyABF

-Numpy

-ffmpeg (optional for saving as mp4 

### How to
